Thank you for purchasing Hamburger Meal!

The models are intended to be used as props.
All materials except for the tray and the paper have color texture and normalmap texture.
In order to use the props, simply drag and drop the prefabs from the “prefab” folder into the scene.
Please make sure you use prefabs instead of the original models in “Models” folder. The original models don't have materials attached to them.
